**Day**: 24\
**Content**: Reading and Writing to Files

This is my attempt at Day 24. Writing to a file that doesn't exist creates a file - neat. My code for creating a file to
 save and track high score in Snake worked, but the solution code is a bit cleaner and nicer. 

As for the Mail Merge exercise, my thinking on using a global variable to track the [name] was on the right track, which is what the solution code 
does. Though I ultimately did not use a global variable, I can appreciate how doing so is a better way to code something like this.
There are also other differences between my code (with the help of Claude) and the solution code, but the functionality is the same.
