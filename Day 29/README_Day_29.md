### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
Where to start with this Day's content? It started innocently enough, with most of the challenges and activities building on what was covered in Days 27 and Day 28. Where things really got interesting was near the end, with the last two set of challenges. This is where many disparate concepts from earlier lessons came together to shine. Essentially, code was taken from Day 5 and significantly shortened using concepts from subsequent Days. Such a simple thing happened and yet it was exciting and beautiful to see and, especially, understand what was happening. What I felt working through this Day's problems is why I wanted to start coding. I hope this feeling carries on as I go through more and more advanced concepts.
