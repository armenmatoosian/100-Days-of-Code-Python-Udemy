After a very long hiatus, this is my attempt at Day 18 of the 100 Days of Code course by Angela Yu on Udemy. My return to the course was actually with Day 15 but I've removed that folder from the repo since I couldn't revise commit history for the README file to remove sensitive information (that, in hindsight, shouldn't have been there in the first place). Hopefully, I'll learn how to properly alter commit history and come back to fix this later on.

Speaking of learning, I've also learned that it's wise to save your work regularly, as I lost my code for part of this day's projects, and to use more descriptive, specific names for commits. I could also use something like GitKraken or GitHub desktop but I want to use git via a terminal (Git BASH) to learn and get comfortable with the fundamentals. I'm also transitioning from Windows to Linux as my primary OS, so using a terminal as much as possible keeps things fresh.
