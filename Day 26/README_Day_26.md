**Day**: 26\
**Content**: List and Dictionary Comprehension

This is my attempt at Day 26. This was a relatively straightforward day in terms of challenges. The NATO alphabet project was provided a good test of comprehensions. I didn't get the final solution entirely (the final list being printed was out of order compared to the solution code), but I made sure to understand the solution code (iterating through a dictionary for each entry in a list) and it was a small enough part of the project that I felt I could move on.
