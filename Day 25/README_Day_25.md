**Day**: 25\
**Content**: Pandas, CSVs, and US State Game inspired by Sporcle

This is my attempt at Day 25. It took a very long time to get through writing the code for the US States Game. The struggle was real. I had quite a bit of help from Claude and my code is **very** different from the solution code. I overcomplicated it by creating a separate file to create a new class and methods to complete actions when it could all be done in a single file. Watching the solution video makes the solution very obvious in hindsight. This is comforting in that with programming, there's always (in theory) a relatively easy way to check whether your code works - if your program executes as designed, then your code works; if it doesn't, then your code doesn't work. I wish there was such tangible, measurable feedback in other areas of life.

All in all, this was definitely one of the tougher days to get through so far.
