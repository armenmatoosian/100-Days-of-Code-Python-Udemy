### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
Where to start with Day 32? Very mixed day. The main challenge for the day was to create a script to send a happy birthday email based on a csv file containing names, emails, and birthdates. THere were three difficulty levels - normal, hard, and very hard - and I was able to get my code to work using very hard starting file (you can find this in the birthday-wisher-extrahard-start zip file). However, I only got 90% of the way there as my code would only email one person, meaning if there was more than one birthday person, my code would only send an email to the first birthday person in the list.

When I started watching the solution video, I realized I would have been better off using the normal difficulty starting file. It contained more hints which would have served as a better way of refreshing and reviewing previously learned concepts. Instead, by using the very hard starting file, I missed out on this opportunity to reinforce key topics, even though I was able to (mostly) succeed using the very hard difficulty starting file.

In short, using lower difficulty starting files somewhat paradoxically provides a better opportunity to learn, even if doing so makes the challenge itself is much easier to work through.

The last video for the Day covers PythonAnywhere, "a fully-loaded and easy-to-use web-based Python development environment that can be accessed from any device with a browser." It's used to run the Day's code automatically on the cloud.
