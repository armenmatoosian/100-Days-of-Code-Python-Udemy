### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
Today I learned about the subtly fascinating concept that python is a [strongly, dynamically typed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11328920/is-python-strongly-typed) language. The link is to a Stack Overflow post where someone eloquently explains this concept and what it means. Modulo (%) is your friend - it helps in writing better code with better logic less hardcoding, at least with something like this. All in all, this was a fun day to work through - not too hard, not too easy, just the right level of challenging problems.
