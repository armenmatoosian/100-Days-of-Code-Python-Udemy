After a very long hiatus, this is my attempt at Day 15 of the 100 Days of Code course by Angela Yu on Udemy. I was somewhat surprisingly able to write nearly all of the code myself with minimal AI help (80/20 maybe?), mainly using Claude Sonnet 3.7 to troubleshoot erros and ask for correct syntax. Claude also helped me with git, which makes GitHub Desktop super easy to use by comparison (or maybe I should use Linux, which seems to be GitLab's native environment).

My code is admittedly quite janky but I wanted to complete Day 15 so I can move on to Day 16 and progress through the course. I hope pushing through like this builds momentum to finish the course, and I can improve how I code (probably could have used functions here) as I move along.
