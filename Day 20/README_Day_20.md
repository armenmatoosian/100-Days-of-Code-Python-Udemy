This is my attempt at Day 20. I got really stuck where you have to create a snake class and use OOP (refactoring the original code). I had some of the logic right but could not set up the class correctly. Even asking Claude for help didn't help. Classes continue to be something I struggle with and need to improve upon. This said, I did end the day's activities on a positive note.
