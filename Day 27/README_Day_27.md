### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
This is my attempt at Day 27. The challenges for this day were very straightforward and simple to work through. That's because new concepts, like *args, **kwargs, and creating GUIs, were introduced, and only the basics of these concepts were covered. Nonetheless, it feels good to pick up and use concepts without bashing your head against the wall.
