### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
A piece of advice from the last video from this Day was something to the effect of "if you can do something with if/else, then do it with if/else". I find that to be odd advice but it makes sense based on the explanation to only use exception handling when something happens rarely and/or you don't have an easy alternative, while if/else should be used whenever possible and when something/errors can happen more frequently. I was really happy with my code for the second challenge, Search for a Website in the Password Manager, since I had used the Day's teachings regarding error handling to capture both missing file and key errors. However, the solution uses if/else to catch key errors and only uses try/except to catch missing file errors. This experience reminds me of a powerful life adage - KISS, which of course stands for Keep It Simple Stupid. Wise words to live by when coding and doing pretty much anything in life.
