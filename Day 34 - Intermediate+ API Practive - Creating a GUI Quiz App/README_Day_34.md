### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
This was a straightforward, dare I say easy, Day. Didn't use AI though I did use a classic programmer tool - google. Even though it was an easier Day to work through, there were a lot of cool things introduced, like unescaping HTML entities, type hints, and declaring and specifying data types of variables and outputs, respectively.
