### **Thoughts, Learnings, and Challenges**
This was a tough day. I was able to figure out 60% to 70% of the code, but I got stuck during key parts of steps 3 and 4 and had to resort to watching the solution videos in order to move on. It was also the first time in probably more than 10 Days where my final code doesn't meet all project criteria and work as intended. On the positive side, I do understand the solution code and will review before starting Day 32. Still, I am disappointed I couldn't figure the code for myself. Onwards and upwards.
